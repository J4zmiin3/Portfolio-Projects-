I've been thinking of everything
I used to want to be
I've been thinking of everything
Of me, of you and me

This is the story of my life
These are the lies I have created
These are the lies I have created

I'm in the middle of nothing
And it's where I want to be
Why at the bottom of everything
I finally start to believe

This is the story of my life
These are the lies I have created
These are the lies I have created
I created

And I swear to God
I'll find myself
In the end
In the end
In the end
In the end

In the end
In the end
In the end
In the end
This is the story of my life
These are the lies I have created
These are the lies I have created
These are the lies I have created
These are the lies I have created
